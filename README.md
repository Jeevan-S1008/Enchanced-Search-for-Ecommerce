## Abstract
The Enhanced Search for Ecommerce App project aims to revolutionize the search experience within an ecommerce application by integrating natural language processing and web scraping capabilities. The system harnesses the power of the OpenAI GPT API to interpret user prompts, enabling dynamic and context-aware searches. Users can input queries in natural language, such as "What all things should I buy for a Goa trip," and the system responds with a curated list of items relevant to the query.

## Introduction
The Enhanced Search for Ecommerce App is a project aimed at improving the search functionality by leveraging ChatGPT's API and web scraping. It involves developing a webpage that allows users to input natural language queries, such as "What should I buy for a Goa trip?" and receive a list of relevant items along with links to purchase them from various e-commerce websites.

## System Architecture
The Enhanced Search for Ecommerce App is designed with a modular and scalable architecture to seamlessly integrate frontend, backend, and external services. The overall system architecture is illustrated below:
